Conditional Breakpoints
--------------------------------------------------------------------
<with prog1.c>
- While Breakpoint enables program stops execution at that point
- What if one needs to break when a specific condition is met
   → say when for loop is at its second but last step or something else
   → The way to do this is
      ⇒ break <position> if <expression>
      ⇒ <position> could be a function name of line number
   →  if break point already exist then a condition can be appended
      ⇒ condition <bp_number> <expression>

Watchpoints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<with prog2.c>
- Watchpoints are similar to breakpoints
   → Are set on variables
   → Triggered when variables are read or write  
   → Variable on which watchpoint needs to be set should be in curent scope of execution
   → watchpoint can be anytime set on global variables
- How to set watchpoint on a varaiable
   → There are three wtachpoints
      ⇒ WRITE
         • watch <variable-name>
      ⇒ READ
         • rwatch <variable-name>
      ⇒ READ & WRITE
         • awatch <variable-name>          • 
      ⇒ single step shall not get watchbreakpoint
      ⇒ to disable watchpoint
         • disable <breakpoint number>
      ⇒ to enable wtahcpoint
         • disable <breakpoint number>
      ⇒ to delete watch simply delete breakpoint
- watch breakpoints are non persistent, if we restart they are lost
