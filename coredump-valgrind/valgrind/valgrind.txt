Valgrind
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◇ Valgrind - purpose - Programatical errors which arent caught by compiler 
- Debugging tool, it has wrapper around various tools used for debugging
- Valgrind Memcheck is a tool that detects memory leaks and memory errors. 
- Some of the most difficult C bugs come from mismanagement of memory
   → allocating the wrong size 
   → using an uninitialized pointer
      ⇒ -wall flag will enable gcc to identify this 
   → accessing memory after it was freed
   → overrunning a buffer, and so on.

- Some of Memory access violations  → some of these seems to have been caught with latest gcc
   → using uninitialized variables
   → memory out of bonds [r/w overflowa/underflow]
   → uaf - use after free 
   → uar - use after return -> out of scope bugs
- To run vallgrind
   → $valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes <./prog-executable-name>
- Demo of leaky programs
