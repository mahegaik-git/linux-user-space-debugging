- Breakpoints
   → Main purpose is to use gdb with break point -> stop observe and proceed
   → We wouldnt need it for running
   → <purpose of breakpoint>
   → We can use breakpoint on function name or line number
      ⇒ break <function-name>
      ⇒ break <line-number>
   → To know what functions are available
      ⇒ info functions
         • Cannot debug glibc but only user defined functions
      ⇒ break main
   → To know line number or list source code
      ⇒ list -> it will print 12 lines
      ⇒ Can type list again to get more lines
      ⇒ Again list for line 1 one can do line 1
   → To know what all break points available
      ⇒ info breakpoints
   → Run program post adding break points
   → Once  execution stops
      ⇒ next can be run for every next command to be executed
   → To finish function we can just do finish and that function will be completed
   → To delete breakpoint 
      ⇒ delete 1 or delete 2
   → continue to proceed and hit next breakpoint
      ⇒ run and continue difference
   → we can use b and line number <b is shortcut>
   → next will not step into a function
      ⇒ Show example
   → step will go inside function
